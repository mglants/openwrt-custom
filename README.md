## About

This repository contains a custom **OpenWrt firmware** focused on reliability, reproducibility, and autonomous operation in constrained network environments.
The goal is to provide a ready-to-use system that requires minimal user configuration while remaining flexible and maintainable over time.

- Nikki is main software for VLESS subscriptions
- Some packages are added to make VPN tunnels
- Minimal software packs for routers
- For LTE/4G routers software are included
- No custom build or kernel, just repacking
- Suggestions are welcomed

The firmware includes a curated set of networking and management packages:

- `nikki`
- `luci-app-nikki`
- `luci`
- `kmod-amneziawg`
- `luci-proto-amneziawg`
- `amneziawg-tools`
- `luci-proto-wireguard`
- `wireguard-tools`
